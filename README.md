# Fraud Detection with Medicare Provider Data
This respository contains the code and accompanying presentation materials for Team Bloom's final project for the Erdős Institute's Fall 2022 Cőde Data Science Boot Camp. Team Bloom consists of [Austin Knies](https://github.com/austinknies) and [Jonathan Leslie](https://github.com/jonles7).

## Getting Started 
To run this code, users must first [download the CMS data](https://data.cms.gov/provider-summary-by-type-of-service/medicare-physician-other-practitioners/medicare-physician-other-practitioners-by-provider-and-service) used for this project to their working directory. File names must also be abbreviated to `DXX_Prov_Svc.csv` where `XX` $\\in \\{13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20\\} \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ for each year of data. 

To run the code properly, follow the numerical order included in the file name:

0. Data Importing and Cleaning.ipynb
1. Data Exploration and Formatting.ipynb
2. Anomaly Detection.ipynb
